## ✒️ About Me
I grew up surrounded by computers from a young age, and over time, this interest turned into a deep passion in areas such as software, graphic design, and e-commerce. Today, I help brands make a difference in the digital world with the knowledge and skills I gained in these areas.

Coding has always been a passion for me. This adventure, which I started in my childhood, has continued to develop with various projects until today. I develop user-friendly and functional software, websites and applications. My goal is always to produce technically strong, easy-to-use and aesthetically pleasing solutions. I have worked on both MAC and Windows platforms and carried out different projects.

Graphic design is another strength of mine. I am very experienced in Photoshop, Illustrator and other design tools. I have been involved in many different projects from logo design to corporate identity, from posters and brochures to business cards. When making my designs, I prioritize simplicity and functionality, and create visually impressive works by playing with colors and perspective. I love taking your abstract ideas and bringing them to life in a concrete way with a professional approach.

I also work in the field of e-commerce. I develop e-commerce platforms for businesses to grow their presence in the digital world, and I help them increase their sales by creating digital marketing strategies. My biggest goal is to use technology and design together to make brands more vocal in the digital world.
